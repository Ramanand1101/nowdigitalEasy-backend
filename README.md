# Node.js User API with Swagger Documentation

This is a simple Node.js application that provides an API for managing users. The API includes basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user data, and the documentation is powered by Swagger.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Make sure your MongoDB server is up and running)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- **POST /api/users**: Create a new user.
- **GET /api/users**: Get a list of all users.
